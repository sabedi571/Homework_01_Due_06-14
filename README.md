Horiseon Refactoring project.

In this refactorig assignment we organized Horiseon website by using semnatic html elements. By using HTML semantics i was able to make the website more accessible for people and machines. Making code more accessible makes it easier to maintain and easier to edit in the future.Using semantics 

Company webpages constantly change to represent the new services and product they provide, so making the code more accessible by using semantics can be very helpful when new engineers review and edit the code. 

In addition to using HTML semantics i followed a logical structure to define the header, the main body and footer of the code so its easier for another person or machine to determine where the addition to code should go. 

I also organized the CSS to represent the code in sequesntial order. 

This was my first time refactoring a code. Even though it was a very rewarding experience it had its fair share of challenges. Biggest challenge was to re-write the css and have the final website look exactly like it did before.

In conclusion, i learned a lot doing this project and it was very rewarding at the end after it finally worked.
